# Sentiment Analysis of English Texts

This repository contains jupyter notebooks that we have used for performing sentiment analysis. This project uses two ML models: **Naive Bayes** and **SVM** and classifies texts as positive or negative.
Also, we have created a sentiment analysis web-app using **Streamlit** which takes user input and recognizes their true sentiments based on the models that we have trained.
